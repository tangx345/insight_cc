This is the directory where all tests resides.

* Provided test is `test_1`.
* Self-created tests are named as `test_x`, where x goes as 2, 3, 4, ...
* `test_2` contains garbage input in which all streams are all invalid, just to check if stream checking function is working well.
* `test_3` and `test_4` contains same self-created input file, but with different percentile number, they together check if main function is working well to pick out repeat donors.
